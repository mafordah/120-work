# Summary

This week I learned more about loops, `for` and `while`, and how to use them.

I was very excited to have an open project this week. With Halloween coming up, I knew I wanted to do a creature that would emit something that I would create with a loop. I started drawing out a polygonal dragon, and it started to look more and more like a horse. So, I decide to code a unicorn.

I made all of the head and body with quadrilaterals and triangles to keep a low-poly look. I started with the head and then made it rotate similarly to how I have done rotations in the past using modulo. I then made the laser with a `for` loop and used the `mouseIsPressed` variable for the first time.

# Problems

The only problem I came across is the error that occurs when you try to use a negative in a `for` loop. I had to adjust almost my entire drawing to compensate for the loop only moving in a positive direction. This is why my code is so messy with all the `push()`, `pop()`, `rotate()`, and `translate()` I had to use to get everything in the right spot. Had I realized this in the beginning, I wouldn't have started with the unicorn on the right side of the screen at first.

Is there a way to do a negative `for` loop with out crashing the entire tab, or is there another function that removes that error. I found a forum that had some information but I couldn't wrap my head around it yet. I can't imagine you just can't repeat something up or left, or maybe that's why most side scrolling games move right.

# Helping Others

Hopefully I helped someone having some trouble with defining variables this week. I'm finishing late tonight so I'm unsure if I was helpful.

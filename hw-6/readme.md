# Summary

This week I learned how to use mathematical functions to create a drawing that changed overtime. Along with the required functions:

* addition
* subtraction
* division
* modulo

I also became familiar with the `if(){}` and `else(){}` functions to make my sketch work.

# My Steps

After I came up with an idea, I had to figure out how to execute it. I knew for sure I wanted the color to change over time. The best way I thought to do this was to use the modulo function and mapping to the color. I then figured out how lines should move back and forth. Then I use variables to get both of these functions to bounce back and forth. The lines move using variables, random numbers, the floor function, and the square root function. The first variable is created with the floor and random functions, and then the second variable is created using the square root of the first variable divided by the third variable that effects the motion.

# Problems

It took me a really long time to get the functions to bounce back and forth. Once I learned the `if` statement I was able to get the color to work but it would spit out one black line in the middle of the white cycle and one white line in the middle of the black cycle. I finally figured out that I had the if and else functions in the wrong order for the operation. It then worked how I wanted it to.

The line movement was more difficult to put in a if function. I thought I could use variables and make one negative, but I think my use of the `sqrt()` function wouldn't let the variable work as a negative. I then came up with the idea to add another variable an divide by it to make the movement negative. I was very surprised that it worked, but I guess dividing my a negative makes a negative number.

# Helping Others

I tried to help someone in how to use the random function, but I'm not sure I answered the question they had very well. I also provided an example of how to use the modulo function. I posted and explained the modulo code I used in my project this week
